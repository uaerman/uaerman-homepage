### Getting started

It's actually a very simple project, I don't think you'll have any difficulties getting started.

1. Create `.env` file in project 

```js

PORT=Project port

DB_URI=MongoDB Url

```

2. Then if you want directly start project use `npm start` command but if you want develop something use `npm run dev`command either way npm packages installing automatically
3. Done
